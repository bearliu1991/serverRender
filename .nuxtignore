# You can use a .nuxtignore file to let Nuxt.js ignore layout, page, store and middleware files in your projectâ€™s root directory (rootDir) during the build phase. The .nuxtignore file is subject to the same specification as .gitignore and .eslintignore files, in which each line is a glob pattern indicating which files should be ignored.

# ignore pages
pages/**/components/*.vue
